<h1>Battlecode Code Generation</h1>
<p>This python script is used to generate an unrolled breadth first search on a grid in java. Battlecode has tight computational limits so it is imperative to minimize unnecessary operations. Loop unrolling works in this case because pathfinding can only search in a fixed 5x5 grid around each entity.</p>
